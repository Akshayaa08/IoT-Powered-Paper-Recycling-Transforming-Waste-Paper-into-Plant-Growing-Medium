### **IoT-Powered-Paper-Recycling-Transforming-Waste-Paper-into-Plant-Growing-Medium**


**Paperizer** is an innovative project designed to combat the growing problem of paper waste and its adverse effects on the environment. By leveraging the power of IoT and smart automation, **Paperizer** transforms waste paper into a nutrient-rich medium for plant growth. This cost-effective and eco-friendly solution promotes sustainability and responsible recycling practices.

The project integrates **Blynk**, a powerful IoT platform, to enable real-time monitoring and remote control of the recycling process, making it accessible and user-friendly.



## **Key Features**
1. **IoT-Enabled Automation**:
   - The system uses IoT sensors to measure the pH level of the paper slurry after the de-inking process.
   - Automated chemical dosing motors neutralize the slurry and prepare it as a plant-friendly medium.

2. **Blynk Integration**:
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**:
     - Live pH data is displayed on the Blynk mobile app dashboard.
   - **Remote Control**:
     - Users can start or stop the dosing motor directly from the app.
   - **Notifications**:
     - Alerts users if the pH level falls outside the optimal range.
   - **Historical Data**:
     - Logs pH levels over time for analysis and optimization.

3. **De-Inking and Neutralization**:
   - Waste paper is treated with specific de-inking chemicals to remove inks, pigments, and resins.
   - The pH of the resulting mixture is balanced to make it suitable for plants.

4. **Eco-Friendly Recycling**:
   - Reduces landfill waste by repurposing paper into a useful, nutrient-rich growing medium.
   - Minimizes the use of harsh chemicals, ensuring an environmentally sustainable process.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - Offers a cheaper alternative to traditional fertilizers and cocopeat.
   - Lowers operational costs by automating pH balancing and chemical dosing.
